   - CONFIGURE: Rate limiting

2. **A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures**
   - ENABLE: HTTPS in production
   - ADD: HSTS header
   - ENCRYPT: Sensitive data at rest

3. **A03:2021 – Injection**
   - ✅ Current validation adequate
   - MONITOR: For new input vectors

4. **A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration**
   - ADD: Security headers immediately
   - DISABLE: Detailed error messages in production
   - REMOVE: Development endpoints

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

The Wonder Healthcare Platform has made **significant progress** with the data loading issue resolved and the Azure GPT engine now functional. However, with only 1 of 3 engines working and critical security gaps, the platform is **not ready for production deployment**.

**Estimated Time to Production Ready**: 48-72 hours of focused development

**Priority Actions**:
1. Fix the two broken engines (4-8 hours)
2. Add security headers and authentication (8-16 hours)
3. Optimize GPT performance with caching (8-12 hours)
4. Implement monitoring and testing (16-24 hours)

The platform shows promise with its strong architectural foundation and successful AI integration. With the identified issues addressed, it can become a robust production system.
