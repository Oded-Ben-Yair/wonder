## 💡 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Playwright Tests Failing (8/10)
**Problem**: Tests timing out looking for "שלח" button
**Cause**: Button selector might have changed in production build
**Solution**: Update test selectors or use more generic selectors (e.g., `button[type="submit"]`)

### Issue 2: Port 3000 Occupied
**Status**: UI auto-switched to port 3001
**Impact**: None - tests should use TEST_URL environment variable
**Solution**: `TEST_URL=http://localhost:3001 npx playwright test`

### Issue 3: QuickActions References
**Status**: All removed successfully
**Verified**: No compilation errors, UI working correctly
**Files Cleaned**: ChatBot.tsx, he.ts translations
